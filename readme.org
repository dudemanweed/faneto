* faneto
** NAME
faneto - Tool to get all the subdomains of a domain using Certificate
Logs
** SYNOPSIS
=faneto.pl [-o OUTPUT] [-v] DOMAIN=
** DESCRIPTION
Perl script to scrap the [[https://crt.sh][Certificate Logs]] so you can get all the
subdomains that ever had HTTPS on it.

That log is literally the Certificate Authority log or something like
that, so if there's a DNS record of a subdomain that never had a TLS
certificate, it won't be in the output.
** BUGS
Maybe.
